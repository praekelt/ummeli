        <TEXT>Praekelt Foundation cannot be held responsible for the accuracy of job 
        information, specifications, nor contact information (like fax numbers, telephone

        Ummeli.  We source this information from job search engines like "We got Ads" 
        and other partners.  The database of jobs is however only as strong as the 
        community that uses it, so YALLERS are strongly encouraged to share job 
        opportunities that they know of, with fellow community members.
