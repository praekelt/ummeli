You send SMS\u2019s and make drive-by's.\r\n - You may then enter a destructive phase - depression, self-hatred, anger and a desire for revenge.\r\n \r\n If these signs of obsession sound like you, take a step back from the relationship and speak to a friend. You can get lost inside your own head and be blinded by your feelings. A friend can help. Talk to someone before you do something crazy! ",
